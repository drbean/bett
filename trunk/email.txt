The next set of homework is now up. Please try to look at the site, connected from http://sac.nuu.edu.tw/AFN3Y0.html before Friday.

Now, you can ask questions about Rena, Dr Bean, Jeff, Alex, Cindy and Vicky. Before, Bett was accepting questions which were ungrammatical and which had words which were not in the list. Now, I think I have removed those bugs.

You can try to ask the same questions you asked last week.

But remember that questions must be in the past tense. I often forget to put my question in the past tense also. But the app will only accept questions about the situation before now.

Remember also, that if something was not mentioned in the video, then it can be assumed that answers to questions about that thing are No. So, Rena had no family, and Alex had no parents.

I have not received any more error reports. Please take the time to mention anything which doesn't seem right to you. For example, 'Who was the student who had a cat,' has an answer. But 'Whose grandmother was a farmer?' doesn't have an answer and 'Who was the student whose grandmother was a farmer,' doesn't either. You are going to find problems with the app. Please help me by pointing out wrong answers. You can contact me by using the web form on the app.
