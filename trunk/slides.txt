## Error reports on Bett

Good example from student:

I chose course 1 in this weeks homework, but the
website says my answers are wrong.

At my third attempt my question was:

'Who was a man who flew in a balloon?' and the answer I
wrote is "Steve".

But your website said :

The question, 'Who was a man who flew in a balloon?'
was grammatical, but the answer to 'Who was a man who
flew in a balloon?' is not 'Steve. It's
'Questioner_adventure:
../csfp/LogicalForm.hs:(235,41)-(236,54):
Non-exhaustive patterns in case'. Try again.    

At my fourth attempt my question was:

 "Who flew a glider" and the answer I wrote was " Steve".

But your website said :

'Who flew a glider?' is not a WH-question question.
It's a True/False question question. Try
again.                                                                              

I would be very grateful if you looked into it for me.
Thank you.
